For me, Zoom was just for meetings.🧑‍💻 


I never imagined that I would build an AI Chatbot on it. Isn’t it amazing to have a bot that can assist you with your queries during virtual meetings (especially when you’re sleeping in between the meetings)? 🎓 I’m a student. So if you ask me, yes!!! It is a crazy thing. That’s what my next project is about!!

🤔 I built another AI chatbot, (oh, wait)…

✨ An Intelligent AI ChatBot, that


## ChatBot On Zoom using Cerebras API:

that provides helpful responses to user queries on various topics within their Zoom conversation discussions using Cerebras’ advanced language models on the Zoom Developers’ platform.😊

* You can go through all the steps in detail, in the Project writeup.


### [Cerebras:](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/quickstart)


   * Before diving into Cerebras Inference, you can go through the documentation of AI Agent Bootcamp on the Cerebras site. It helped me to understand the overview of the overall 
     project.You can also explore the components that make up agentic workflows and highlight some key differences in control flow between traditional software and agentic workflows. 
     This makes it a crucial topic for developers interested in building with LLMs.

#### **Your Conversational ChatBot:**

This chatbot will now have a conversation history, which will enable it to end up being more logical and less awkward. As a part of the code, previous messages are saved in memory and attached each time to the subsequent requests to the Cerebras API. This will help the AI to grasp the flow of the conversation and be able to recall what has been said before in the conversation.


* You can also launch your app in Zoom Team Chat with configured shortcuts that will trigger the defined action.
